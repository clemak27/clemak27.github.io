&lt;h2 id="coding">Coding&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I mainly use Java, Go and Java-/Typescript (in NodeJS) for programming,
but I&amp;rsquo;m not afraid to try something new.
I use Linux (specifically NixOS) and do all of my editing in Neovim.
I&amp;rsquo;m also interested in DevOps and have a server at home running NixOS.
Automating all the boring stuff is also a worthwhile goal.
I have a Gitea instance where I keep all my private
repos, the code I feel confident/important enough to share is on GitHub.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="music">Music&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I mostly listen to progressive rock and other slightly weird music.
I&amp;rsquo;m also not averted to more classical music and soundtracks. Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve
also explored a more ambient/electronic sound. I also picked up a guitar at the end
of 2021. I also have a small collection of Vinyls. Eventually, I want to learn more
about music production and synthesizers or might even pick up a keyboard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For reference, here is one of my favorite songs and a
good example what I like:&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="space">Space&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Space has always fascinated me since my childhood, both the scientific
background and its exploration by humanity. One of the reasons I started
studying physics was exactly this fascination.
Nowadays, I mostly try to keep up with the newest advancements and
developments in the field, like the Artemis missions or the
discoveries the JWST makes.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="sci-fi">Sci-Fi&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I enjoy watching science fiction movies (and playing sci-fi games) that are both
entertaining and thought-provoking. Bladerunner 2049 is a good example for that
(and also visually beautiful in my opinion). Finding time to watch everything I
want is hard though.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="sports">Sports&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>While I used to watch Formula 1 in the past, I don&amp;rsquo;t really care about it anymore
and don&amp;rsquo;t follow any news about it.
Other types of sport never really interested me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Personally, I like hiking in summer when the weather is good enough.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="gaming">Gaming&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I used to play quite a lot on Nintendo consoles when I was younger.
Nowadays, when playing games, I mostly enjoy indie and older titles
on my PC or my Steam Deck.
While I try to focus on other hobbies at the moment, I still follow
gaming news and watch videos about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As for multiplayer games, I spent way too many hours playing
Guild Wars when I was a teenager (And I still regard it as one
of my favorite games of all time).
I also played quite a lot of StarCraft II when it was still
relatively popular, although I was never especially good at it.
I also played many hours of Guild Wars 2, but my opinion on that
is a bit more complicated.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>About this page</title><link>https://clemak27.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://clemak27.github.io/about/</guid><description>This site was created by me, using hugo.</description><content>&lt;p>This site was created by me, using &lt;a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo">hugo&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>homelab</title><link>https://clemak27.github.io/homelab/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://clemak27.github.io/homelab/</guid><description>I have a small server at home, running some services host for myself.

My journey so far My Linux journey took me to many distributions over the years:
Linux Mint Guess everyone had to start somewhere ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. For the things I did back then, which was mostly taking notes for university classes and some simple programming, it was ok. Cinnamon was also fine at the beginning, coming from Windows.
Ubuntu After that, I used vanilla Ubuntu for a while (back in a time when it was still kinda ok and not full of snaps).</description><content>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/clemak27/linux_setup">dotfiles etc. are here&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>My Linux journey took me to many distributions over the years:&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="linux-mint">Linux Mint&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Guess everyone had to start somewhere ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. For the things I did back
then, which was mostly taking notes for university classes and some simple
programming, it was ok. Cinnamon was also fine at the beginning, coming from Windows.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="ubuntu">Ubuntu&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>After that, I used vanilla Ubuntu for a while (back in a time when it was still
kinda ok and not full of snaps). I thought the way GNOME worked with the
different workspaces was cool.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="kubuntu">Kubuntu&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I soon switched to KDE Plasma in the form of Kubuntu. Which was awesome, all the
things you could customize. The whole set of KDE software is also more up
my alley than their GNOME equivalents.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="manjaro">Manjaro&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>While I was occasionally still dual booting windows until now, it was finally
time to use Linux all the time, also on my desktop PC. I needed and wanted more
up-to-date software for this, so I switched to a rolling release distro and
ended up with Manjaro. The few months I used it, it was quite ok, and also
supported my hardware well. That said, there were and still are some concerns
with Manjaro (there a good write-up &lt;a href="https://manjarno.snorlax.sh/">here&lt;/a>).
So I just went to use Arch proper.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="arch-linux">Arch Linux&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Despite the common opinion, I found Arch actually be easy to install, the guide
in the archwiki is pretty detailed. I also soon began documenting and automating
the installation process to fit my needs in case I wanted to start fresh. That said,
Arch has been extremely stable for me and the legendary wiki and a community has
a wealth of knowledge if one encounters problems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the years I used Arch, I also learned a lot of new things about the inner
workings of Linux. This was also the time-period where I learned to love vim,
which I use daily now. While still staying with Plasma most of the time, I also
used i3 for a while (and took one or 2 looks what GNOME is up to)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While Arch really is awesome (and I would everyone interested in Linux to at
least try it out for a while) there were also a few things that annoyed me.
As already said, I documented my whole setup and ended up with some pretty
convoluted installation scripts. That said, such scripts take also time to maintain,
and testing them would usually mean spinning up a VM etc. Not to mention the
not-so-nice experience of not writing down a magic command that fixes an issue.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="nixos">NixOS&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I eventually came to know the Nix ecosystem. After using the (community made)
home-manager tool to manage my dotfiles, I took the plunge and replaced
Arch with NixOS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are 2 things I find great about Nix: The whole system-configuration in
declared in one file, and the system is set up exactly the way it is defined,
with all packages and customizations. The second is the awesome nix_shell,
that creates local development environments in an awesome way. Want to see how
your node14 application works with node16? Just create a nix-shell without
screwing up your global install or setting up something like &lt;a href="https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm">NVM&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="fedora-silverblue">Fedora Silverblue&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Despite my initial hype for NixOS I was not 100% satisfied with it.
I switched to Fedora Silverblue. I like its combination of containers,
Flatpak and the toolbox. That said, I currently still use home-manager
to organize my dotfiles, which is both because it would require additional
migration work, and because it allows me to use my dotfiles anywhere else where
Nix is available. While I did think about returning to NixOS for a while,
I see no reason to change for now. Fedora just works™&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="returning-to-nixos">Returning to NixOS&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>After more than a year running Silverblue, I returned to NixOS.
This was mostly due to my stubbornness to migrate my dotfiles from Nix
to something else. Running my whole setup inside a toolbox worked for many things,
but did have some issue with containerization. Also, over time, the setup of my
Linux machines and their actual state started to drift.
I currently see no reason to switch from something else.&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
