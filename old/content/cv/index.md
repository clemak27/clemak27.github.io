## Who am I?

My name is Clemens and I currently work as a Software Engineer, maintaining and
extending backend services.

## Education

I got a B.Sc. in Computer Science at UAS Technikum Wien. I also studied physics
for a while until I figured out it wasn't for me.

## Coding

I mainly use Java, Go and Java-/Typescript (in NodeJS) for programming,
but I'm not afraid to try something new.
I use Linux (specifically NixOS) and do all of my editing in Neovim.
I'm also interested in DevOps and have a server at home running NixOS.
Automating all the boring stuff is also a worthwhile goal.
I have a Gitea instance where I keep all my private
repos, the code I feel confident/important enough to share is on GitHub.

## Music

I mostly listen to progressive rock and other slightly weird music.
I'm also not averted to more classical music and soundtracks. Recently, I've
also explored a more ambient/electronic sound. I also picked up a guitar at the end
of 2021. I also have a small collection of Vinyls. Eventually, I want to learn more
about music production and synthesizers or might even pick up a keyboard.

For reference, here is a good example what I like:

<!-- but seriously, how can this song be so fucking good? -->

## Space

Space has always fascinated me since my childhood, both the scientific
background and its exploration by humanity. One of the reasons I started
studying physics was exactly this fascination.
Nowadays, I mostly try to keep up with the newest advancements and
developments in the field, like the Artemis missions or the
discoveries the JWST makes.

## Sci-Fi

I enjoy watching science fiction movies (and playing sci-fi games) that are both
entertaining and thought-provoking. Bladerunner 2049 is a good example for that
(and also visually beautiful in my opinion). Finding time to watch everything I
want is hard though.

## Sports

While I used to watch Formula 1 in the past, I don't really care about it anymore
and don't follow any news about it.
Other types of sport never really interested me.

Personally, I like hiking in summer when the weather is good enough.

## Gaming

I used to play quite a lot on Nintendo consoles when I was younger.
Nowadays, when playing games, I mostly enjoy indie and older titles
on my PC or my Steam Deck.
While I try to focus on other hobbies at the moment, I still follow
gaming news and watch videos about it.

As for multiplayer games, I spent way too many hours playing
Guild Wars when I was a teenager (And I still regard it as one
of my favorite games of all time).
I also played quite a lot of StarCraft II when it was still
relatively popular, although I was never especially good at it.
I also played many hours of Guild Wars 2, but my opinion on that
is a bit more complicated.
