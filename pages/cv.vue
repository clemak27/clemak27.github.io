        <h1> About me </h1>

        <h3> Who am I? </h3>
        My name is Clemens and I currently work as a Software Developer, maintaining and extending backend services.

        <h3> Education </h3>
        I got a BSc in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.technikum-wien.at/en/">UAS Technikum Wien</a>. I also studied physics for a while until I figured out it wasn't for me.

        <h3> Coding </h3>
        I mainly use Java, Go and nodejs for programming, but I'm not afraid to try something new. There's also an interest in DevOps stuff and I have a server at home running NixOS. Automating all the boring stuff is also a worthwhile goal.
        I have a <a href="https://gitea.io/en-us/">gitea</a> instance where I keep all my private repos, the code I feel confident enough to share is on <a href="https://github.com/clemak27">GitHub</a>. I'm a Linux user and do all of my editing in neovim and IntelliJ.

        <h3> Music </h3>
        I mostly listen to progressive rock and other slightly weird music. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFwcahcDzP4">Here's a good example of music I like</a>. I also picked up a guitar at the end of 2021 and have been practicing since then.

        <h3>Space</h3>
        Space has always fascinated me since my childhood, both the scientific background and its exploration by humanity.

        <h3>Sci-Fi</h3>
        I enjoy watching science fiction movies (and playing scifi games) that are both entertaining and thought-provoking. Bladerunner 2049 is a good example for that (and also visually beautiful in my opinion). Finding time to watch everything I want is hard though.

        <h3>Sports</h3>
        I'm not really into sports (and not very sporty myself), but I do enjoy watching Formula 1.
        I also like walking/hiking if the situation presents itself.

        <h3>Gaming</h3>
        I do enjoy a good game from time to time. I used to play quite a lot on nintendo consoles when I was younger, nowadays I mostly enjoy indie and older titles on my PC. I also spend way too many hours playing Guild Wars when I was a teenager.
