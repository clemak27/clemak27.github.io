extending backend services.</p><h2 id=education>Education<a href=#education class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><p>I got a B.Sc. in Computer Science at UAS Technikum Wien. I also studied physics
for a while until I figured out it wasn&rsquo;t for me.</p><h2 id=coding>Coding<a href=#coding class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><p>I mainly use Java, Go and Java-/Typescript (in NodeJS) for programming,
but I&rsquo;m not afraid to try something new. There&rsquo;s also an interest in DevOps
and I have a server at home running Fedora CoreOS. Automating all the boring
stuff is also a worthwhile goal. I also find the whole Nix ecosystem both
awesome and fascinating. I have a Gitea instance where I keep all my private
repos, the code I feel confident/important enough to share is on GitHub.
I&rsquo;m a Linux user and do all of my editing in Neovim and IntelliJ.</p><h2 id=music>Music<a href=#music class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><p>I mostly listen to progressive rock and other slightly weird music.
I&rsquo;m also not averted to more classical music and soundtracks. Recently, I&rsquo;ve
also explored a more ambient/electronic sound. I also picked up a guitar at the end
of 2021 but struggle to find time to practice it. I also plan on learning more
about music production and synthesizers in the future or might pick up a keyboard.</p><p>For reference, these are more or less my favorite artists (in no particular order):</p><ul><li>Ayreon</li><li>Devin Townsend</li><li>Dream Theater</li><li>Nightwish</li><li>Opeth</li><li>Pink Floyd</li><li>Porcupine Tree</li><li>Riverside</li><li>Steven Wilson</li><li>Tool</li></ul><h2 id=space>Space<a href=#space class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><p>Space has always fascinated me since my childhood, both the scientific
background and its exploration by humanity. One of the reasons I started
studying physics was exactly this fascination.</p><h2 id=sci-fi>Sci-Fi<a href=#sci-fi class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><p>I enjoy watching science fiction movies (and playing sci-fi games) that are both
entertaining and thought-provoking. Bladerunner 2049 is a good example for that
(and also visually beautiful in my opinion). Finding time to watch everything I
want is hard though.</p><h2 id=sports>Sports<a href=#sports class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><p>I&rsquo;m not really into sports (and not very sporty myself). I used to watch
Formula 1 in the past though. I also like walking/hiking to places.</p><h2 id=gaming>Gaming<a href=#gaming class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><p>I do enjoy a good game from time to time. I used to play quite a lot
on Nintendo consoles when I was younger, nowadays, I mostly enjoy indie
and older titles on my PC. I also spend way too many hours playing
Guild Wars when I was a teenager. Just don&rsquo;t ask me about my opinion on
Guild Wars 2, it&rsquo;s complicated.</p></div></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=copyright><span>Â© 2023 Powered by <a href=http://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></span>
