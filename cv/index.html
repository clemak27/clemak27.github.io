extending backend services.</p><h2 id=education>Education<a href=#education class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><p>I got a B.Sc. in Computer Science at UAS Technikum Wien. I also studied physics
for a while until I figured out it wasn&rsquo;t for me.</p><h2 id=coding>Coding<a href=#coding class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><p>I mainly use Java, Go and Java-/Typescript (in NodeJS) for programming,
but I&rsquo;m not afraid to try something new.
I use Linux (specifically NixOS) and do all of my editing in Neovim.
I&rsquo;m also interested in DevOps and have a server at home running NixOS.
Automating all the boring stuff is also a worthwhile goal.
I have a Gitea instance where I keep all my private
repos, the code I feel confident/important enough to share is on GitHub.</p><h2 id=music>Music<a href=#music class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><p>I mostly listen to progressive rock and other slightly weird music.
I&rsquo;m also not averted to more classical music and soundtracks. Recently, I&rsquo;ve
also explored a more ambient/electronic sound. I also picked up a guitar at the end
of 2021. I also have a small collection of Vinyls. Eventually, I want to learn more
about music production and synthesizers or might even pick up a keyboard.</p><p>For reference, here is one of my favorite songs and a
good example what I like:</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/qFwcahcDzP4 style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><h2 id=space>Space<a href=#space class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><p>Space has always fascinated me since my childhood, both the scientific
background and its exploration by humanity. One of the reasons I started
studying physics was exactly this fascination.
Nowadays, I mostly try to keep up with the newest advancements and
developments in the field, like the Artemis missions or the
discoveries the JWST makes.</p><h2 id=sci-fi>Sci-Fi<a href=#sci-fi class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><p>I enjoy watching science fiction movies (and playing sci-fi games) that are both
entertaining and thought-provoking. Bladerunner 2049 is a good example for that
(and also visually beautiful in my opinion). Finding time to watch everything I
want is hard though.</p><h2 id=sports>Sports<a href=#sports class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><p>While I used to watch Formula 1 in the past, I don&rsquo;t really care about it anymore
and don&rsquo;t follow any news about it.
Other types of sport never really interested me.</p><p>Personally, I like hiking in summer when the weather is good enough.</p><h2 id=gaming>Gaming<a href=#gaming class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><p>I used to play quite a lot on Nintendo consoles when I was younger.
Nowadays, when playing games, I mostly enjoy indie and older titles
on my PC or my Steam Deck.
While I try to focus on other hobbies at the moment, I still follow
gaming news and watch videos about it.</p><p>As for multiplayer games, I spent way too many hours playing
Guild Wars when I was a teenager (And I still regard it as one
of my favorite games of all time).
I also played quite a lot of StarCraft II when it was still
relatively popular, although I was never especially good at it.
I also played many hours of Guild Wars 2, but my opinion on that
is a bit more complicated.</p></div></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=copyright><span>Â© 2023 Powered by <a href=http://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></span>
