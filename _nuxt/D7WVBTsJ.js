",-1),e("h2",{class:"text-lg"}," Coding ",-1),e("p",null," I mainly use Java, Go and Java-/Typescript (in NodeJS) for programming, but I'm not afraid to try something new. I use Linux (specifically NixOS) and do all of my editing in Neovim. I'm also interested in DevOps and have a server at home running NixOS. Automating all the boring stuff is also a worthwhile goal. I have a Gitea instance where I keep all my private repos, the code I feel confident/important enough to share is on GitHub. ",-1),e("h2",{class:"text-lg"}," Music ",-1),e("p",null," I mostly listen to progressive rock and other slightly weird music. I'm also not averted to more classical music and soundtracks. Recently, I've also explored a more ambient/electronic sound. I also picked up a guitar at the end of 2021. I also have a small collection of Vinyls. Eventually, I want to learn more about music production and synthesizers or might even pick up a keyboard. For reference, here is a good example what I like from one of my favourite artists: ",-1),e("iframe",{width:"560",height:"315",src:"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wYfQ1I-VV7M?si=Cp0BVcGKMKKmzU8G",title:"YouTube video player",frameborder:"0",allow:"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share",allowfullscreen:""},null,-1),e("h2",{class:"text-lg"}," Space ",-1),e("p",null," Space has always fascinated me since my childhood, both the scientific background and its exploration by humanity. One of the reasons I started studying physics was exactly this fascination. Nowadays, I mostly try to keep up with the newest advancements and developments in the field, like the Artemis missions or the discoveries the JWST makes. ",-1),e("h2",{class:"text-lg"}," Sci-Fi ",-1),e("p",null," I enjoy watching science fiction movies (and playing sci-fi games) that are both entertaining and thought-provoking. Bladerunner 2049 is a good example for that (and also visually beautiful in my opinion). Finding time to watch everything I want is hard though. I'm also currently reading God Emporer of Dune and have some other novels lined up in my backlog. ",-1),e("h2",{class:"text-lg"}," Sports ",-1),e("p",null," While I used to watch Formula 1 in the past, I don't really care about it anymore and don't follow any news about it. Other types of sport never really interested me. Personally, I like hiking in summer when the weather is good enough, and plan on buying a bicycle in the near future. ",-1),e("h2",{class:"text-lg"}," Gaming ",-1),e("p",null," I used to play quite a lot on Nintendo consoles when I was younger. Nowadays, when playing games, I mostly enjoy indie and older titles on my PC or my Steam Deck. While I try to focus on other hobbies at the moment, I still watch videos about it. As for multiplayer games, I spent way too many hours playing Guild Wars when I was a teenager (And I still regard it as one of my favorite games of all time). I also played quite a lot of StarCraft II when it was still relatively popular, although I was never especially good at it. I also played many hours of Guild Wars 2, but my opinion on that is a bit more complicated. ",-1)]))}const d=t(i,[["render",l]]);export{d as default};
