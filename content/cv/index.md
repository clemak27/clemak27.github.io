## Who am I?

My name is Clemens and I currently work as a Software Engineer, maintaining and
extending backend services.

## Education

I got a BSc in Computer Science at UAS Technikum Wien. I also studied physics
for a while until I figured out it wasn't for me.

## Coding

I mainly use Java, Go and Java-/Typescript (in nodejs) for programming,
but I'm not afraid to try something new. There's also an interest in DevOps
and I have a server at home running Fedora CoreOS. Automating all the boring
stuff is also a worthwhile goal. I also find the whole Nix ecosystem both
awesome and fascinating. I have a gitea instance where I keep all my private
repos, the code I feel confident/important enough to share is on GitHub.
I'm a Linux user and do all of my editing in neovim and IntelliJ.

## Music

I mostly listen to progressive rock and other slightly weird music.
I'm also not averted to more classical music and soundtracks. Recently, I've
also explored a more electronic sound. I also picked up a guitar at the end
of 2021 but stuggle to find time to practise it. I also plan on learning more
about music production and synthesizers in the future or might pick up a keyboard.

For reference, these are more or less my favorite artists (in no particular order):

- Ayreon
- Devin Townsend
- Dream Theater
- Nightwish
- Opeth
- Pink Floyd
- Porcupine Tree
- Riverside
- Steven Wilson
- Tool

## Space

Space has always fascinated me since my childhood, both the scientific
background and its exploration by humanity. One of the reasons I started
study√≠ng physics was exactly this fascination.

## Sci-Fi

I enjoy watching science fiction movies (and playing scifi games) that are both
entertaining and thought-provoking. Bladerunner 2049 is a good example for that
(and also visually beautiful in my opinion). Finding time to watch everything I
want is hard though.

## Sports

I'm not really into sports (and not very sporty myself). I used to watch
Formula 1 in the past though. I also like walking/hiking to places.

## Gaming

I do enjoy a good game from time to time. I used to play quite a lot
on nintendo consoles when I was younger, nowadays I mostly enjoy indie
and older titles on my PC. I also spend way too many hours playing
Guild Wars when I was a teenager. Just don't ask me about my opinion on
Guild Wars 2, it's complicated.
