## Who am I?

My name is Clemens and I currently work as a Software Engineer, maintaining and
extending backend services.

## Education

I got a BSc in Computer Science at UAS Technikum Wien. I also studied physics
for a while until I figured out it wasn't for me.

## Coding

I mainly use Java, Go and nodejs for programming, but I'm not afraid to try
something new. There's also an interest in DevOps stuff and I have a server
at home running Fedora CoreOS. Automating all the boring stuff is also a
worthwhile goal. I also find the whole Nix ecosystem both awesome and
fascinating. I have a gitea instance where I keep all my private repos, the code
I feel confident enough to share is on GitHub. I'm a Linux user and do all of my
editing in neovim and IntelliJ.

## Music

I mostly listen to progressive rock and other slightly weird music.
Here's a good example of music I like, from one of my favorite artists.
I'm also not averted to more classical music and soundtracks. Recently, I've
also explored a more electronic sound. I also picked up a guitar at the end
of 2021 but stuggle to find time to practise it. I also plan on learning more
about music production and synthesizers in the future or might pick up a keyboard.

## Space

Space has always fascinated me since my childhood, both the scientific
background and its exploration by humanity.

## Sci-Fi

I enjoy watching science fiction movies (and playing scifi games) that are both
entertaining and thought-provoking. Bladerunner 2049 is a good example for that
(and also visually beautiful in my opinion). Finding time to watch everything I
want is hard though.

## Sports

I'm not really into sports (and not very sporty myself). I used to watch
Formula 1 in the past though. I also like walking/hiking if the situation
presents itself.

## Gaming

I do enjoy a good game from time to time. I used to play quite a lot
on nintendo consoles when I was younger, nowadays I mostly enjoy indie
and older titles on my PC. I also spend way too many hours playing
Guild Wars when I was a teenager.
